# Sonic Robo Social Experiment
A public mod that anyone can make any change to, as long as it follows the "rules".

# Rules
1. Mod must follow all of the Message Board rules. Naming conventions are an exception.
2. All assets used must either be open assets, made by you, or given proper permission from the owner.
3. You can not change another person's idea. Only that person can remove it themsselves. However, you can bug-fix it for them, re-format the code, or tweak it ever so slightly.
